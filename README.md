My Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier Project
This project is a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using a neural network.

Features
1. Preprocesses raw SMS text into a clean format for modeling
2. Uses a neural network for text classification
3. Evaluates model performance with accuracy metrics
